                <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
                <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a
                small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
                developers to take it in a bunch of different difrections.
                Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node
                sever), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "">Variable Declaration</a>
                    Javascript variables are containers for storing data values 
                    - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, 
                    a variable holds a value. All Javascript must be identified
                    with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
                    <div id="colortext">var x;</div></li>
                    <li><a href = "">Variable Assignment</a>
                    Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - 
                    our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable 
                    a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value
                    to a variable. <div id="colortext">var x = 10;</div></li>
                    <li><a href = "">Data Type</a>
                    Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate 
                    variables, you need to know the data type. There are six 
                    data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean - 
                    true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number -
                    <div id="colortext">42</div> or
                    <div id="colortext">3.14159</div>; String - 
                    <div id="colortext">"Coding Dojo Rockets!";</div> Array - 
                    <div id="colortext">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</div> and Object - 
                    <div id="colortext">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</div></li>
                    <li><a href = "">Conditionals</a>
                    When you write a code, you want to perform different actions 
                    for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based 
                    on values or conditions that have been met. You can use 
                    conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. 
                    These are the following conditional statements:
                    <div id="colortext">if</div> a specified condition is true,
                    do this code in our code block;
                    <div id="colortext">else if</div> to specify a new condition
                    to test, if the  first condition is false;
                    <div id="colortext">else</div> we execute this block
                    of code;</li>
                    <li><a href = "">Loops</a>
                    There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
                    language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they
                    will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to
                    run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then
                    you stop. That's a loop!</li>
                    <li><a href = "">Function</a>
                    Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call 
                    our function, this will run that code block. Think of it as 
                    a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting 
                    together a desk from Ikea. We open up the instruction manual
                    and get started. First, we screw the legs to the table top; 
                    next, we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished 
                    our instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more tables to do, 
                    so let's call our function over and over again.</li>
